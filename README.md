# Mitron-Bank-Credit-Card-Analysis

#  Problem Statement

Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad, plans to introduce a new line of credit cards to expand its market reach.
Before full-scale implementation, the strategy director, Mr. Bashnir Rover, requested a pilot analysis on a sample dataset of 4,000 customers across five major cities.
The objective was to analyze customer income, spending behavior, and payment preferences to identify profitable customer segments and guide the product design strategy.

# Project Goal

The goal of this Power BI dashboard is to:

Understand customer demographics, income patterns, and spending habits.

Identify key customer segments suitable for the new credit-card offerings.

Evaluate income utilization trends to assess spending potential.

Provide data-driven recommendations to support Mitron Bank’s product-launch strategy.

# Key Insights

Credit Cards dominate total spending with ₹216 M, followed by UPI (₹141 M).

Salaried IT Employees show the highest income (₹79.5 M) and utilization (51%), making them the most lucrative segment.

Freelancers demonstrate moderate income but strong utilization (45.8%), showing potential for flexible credit offerings.

Government employees have the lowest utilization (29%), indicating risk-averse behavior.

Age group 25–34 leads total spending with ₹203 M +, representing young working professionals as the core target audience.

Married customers contribute ~81 % of both income and spending, reflecting financial stability.

Male customers account for 67 % of total spending, indicating a gender gap in card usage.

Bengaluru has the highest average income and active-customer base, followed by Mumbai and Delhi NCR.

Overall income utilization is 42.8 %, meaning customers spend less than half their disposable income — ample room for credit-card promotion.

Top spend categories: Food, Apparel, and Electronics dominate total expenditure.
